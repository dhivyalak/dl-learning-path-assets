# dl-learning-path-assets
As a part of my internship with IBM in the summer of 2021, I created educational content for the IBM Developer platform. The primary objectives of this project was to expose users to the "IBM Cloud Pak for Data" platform, while also introducing readers to supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The deliverables for this project were: an article and a corresponding Jupyter notebook containing a code pattern- to be published to the IBM Developer platform. To introduce the reader to supervised learning, we chose to implement Autoencoders, using TensorFlow, to demonstrate how this learning technique can be leveraged for image recognition. For the unsupervised learning materials, a sample of stock data from the IBM Watson data repository was extracted and used to predict the value of the stock data in the future. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), using PyTorch, were implemented to outline to the reader how supervised learning techniques can be utilized.
